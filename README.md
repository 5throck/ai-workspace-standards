# AI Workspace Standards

> **Master configuration for Vibe Coding and Harness Engineering across all AI coding tools.**

This repository defines the shared workspace standards used by every project under the workspace root. It is designed to be cloned directly as the workspace root (`C:\git` on Windows · `~/git` on macOS/Linux) so that all projects inherit the same AI behavior, workflow, and quality rules automatically.

---

## What Is This?

Modern AI-assisted development requires more than prompts - it requires **consistent, enforced behavioral contracts** that every AI tool follows across every project. This repo provides:

| Concern | File | Audience |
|---------|------|----------|
| Shared workspace standards | [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md) | All AI tools |
| Claude Code behaviors | [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Claude Code (CLI + Desktop) |
| Gemini / Antigravity behaviors | [`GEMINI.md`](GEMINI.md) | Gemini CLI + Antigravity engine |
| Change history | [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) | All |

### Two Philosophies, One Standard

**Vibe Coding** - AI takes the wheel. The developer describes intent; the AI agents (PM → Architect → Designer → Code Writer → Test Runner) execute the full workflow autonomously. These standards define the guardrails that keep autonomous execution safe and auditable.

**Harness Engineering** - Developer stays in the loop. AI tools are precision instruments: surgical edits, explicit plans, mandatory review gates. These standards define the harness that keeps AI output predictable and reviewable.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone as workspace root

```bash
# Windows
git clone https://github.com/5throck/ai-workspace-standards.git C:\git

# macOS / Linux
git clone https://github.com/5throck/ai-workspace-standards.git ~/git
```

### 2. Activate local git hooks

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### 3. Create your first project

```bash
# Default (latest template, co-develop variant)
bash scripts/new-project.sh "my-project-name"

# Specify a variant
bash scripts/new-project.sh "my-project-name" --variant co-develop

# Use a specific template version (see available: bash scripts/list-template-versions.sh)
bash scripts/new-project.sh "my-project-name" --version 0.5.0

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\new-project.ps1 "my-project-name"
.\scripts\new-project.ps1 "my-project-name" -Variant co-develop -Version 0.5.0
```

> **AI tool shortcut**: In Claude Code, use `/new-project "my-project-name"` instead of running the script directly.

Each new project is scaffolded from the selected template variant with `docs/context.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `agents/pm.md`, and all required configuration files. The template version and variant are recorded in `docs/context.md` for traceability.

### 4. Move to the new project & Start PM Kick-off

**CRITICAL**: You must exit your current AI session and start a new one inside the newly created project directory. If you remain at the workspace root, the AI will not load the project-specific configuration and will skip the kick-off meeting.

**Provide Context for Better Results**

The PM agent works best when you provide clear context:
1. **Project goal** - What you're building
2. **Agent team hint** (optional) - Suggested specialized agents
3. **Expected output** - Implementation plan, design, code

```bash
# 1. Exit the current AI session (if running)
# 2. Move into the newly created project folder
cd "my-project-name"

# 3. Start a fresh AI session to load project context
claude
# or
agy
```

**Example: Building a Tetris Game**

```
> "Build a Tetris game in TypeScript. Configure a specialized agent team
> (game-design for mechanics, game-logic for collision detection, graphics
> for rendering, qa for testing) and start the kick-off meeting to create
> an implementation plan."
```

This gives the PM agent clear context to:
- Understand your specific requirements
- Configure the right agent team (default or custom)
- Generate a focused kick-off agenda
- Present a concrete plan for your approval

## Session Start Checklist

Every AI session begins by running this checklist (defined in `CONSTITUTION.md`):

0. `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
1. Read `CONSTITUTION.md` (this workspace standard)
2. Read the project's `docs/context.md`
3. Read `AGENTS.md` (canonical agent roster)
4. Check `memory/MEMORY.md` for recent changes
5. Load skills from `docs/context.md ## Session Start Skills`

---

## Multi-Agent Workflow

Projects use a 5-role agent model across 6 governance phases:

```
PM Orchestrator
  │
  ├─ Phase 1-2: Analysis agents (parallel)  →  findings + acceptance criteria
  ├─ Phase 3:   Architect + Designer        →  implementation plan + design spec (user approval required)
  ├─ Phase 4:   Code Writer + Test Runner   →  implementation + verification
  ├─ Phase 5:   QA gate                     →  audit.sh + tests pass
  └─ Phase 6:   Finalization                →  memlog → sync → PR
```

Agent scaffold templates for all roles live in `templates/co-develop/agents/`.

---

## Template Variants

New projects are scaffolded from versioned template variants. Templates are tagged in git as `template-vX.Y.Z`.

| Variant | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `co-develop` | ✅ Stable | Full software development workflow — PM, Architect, Designer, Code Writer, Test Runner, Security Monitor |
| `co-design` | ✅ Stable | UI/UX design workflow — PM, Design Lead, UX Researcher, Visual Designer, Prototype Engineer, Storyteller, Service Designer, Typography Expert |
| `co-work` | ✅ Stable | General collaboration workflow — PM, Analyst, Technical Writer, Content Writer, Project Coordinator, Storyteller, MS365 Expert |

### Selecting a version and variant

```bash
# List available template versions
bash scripts/list-template-versions.sh

# Use latest template (default)
bash scripts/new-project.sh my-project

# Use a specific version
bash scripts/new-project.sh my-project --version 0.5.0

# Use a specific variant
bash scripts/new-project.sh my-project --variant co-develop
```

### Validating templates

When modifying template files, run the lifecycle validator to catch structural issues:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-templates.sh
```

Checks: agent frontmatter completeness, required sections (`## Meeting Participation`, `## Dispatch Protocol`), AGENTS.md roster parity, script `.sh`/`.ps1` parity, and shared file sync warnings. Also runs automatically via pre-commit when `templates/` files are staged.

---

## Design Principles

- **`docs/context.md` is the single source of truth** for every project - all AI tools share it.
- **`CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` (project-level) contain only platform-specific overrides.**
- **PR-only workflow** - all changes reach `main` via Pull Request. Direct push is blocked by `.githooks/pre-push`.
- **Conventional Commits** - `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `refactor:` / `chore:` / `test:` / `perf:` / `ci:` / `style:` / `revert:`
- **Cross-platform scripts** - every `.sh` has a `.cmd`/`.ps1` pair with identical behavior.
- **Coding Guidelines are audited** - `audit.sh` fails the build if `## Coding Guidelines` is missing from `docs/context.md`.
- **Security-First Scaffold** - Projects are automatically equipped with secrets detection (`.gitleaks.toml`), `SECURITY.md`, and secure pre-commit hooks to prevent credential leaks.

---

## Contributing

This is a **public repository**. Contributions are welcome via pull requests.

1. Branch off `main` using the naming convention: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, or `docs/<slug>`
2. All PRs must pass `bash scripts/audit.sh`
3. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `[Unreleased]` before merging
4. Follow `CONSTITUTION.md §8 - Coding Behavior Guidelines`
5. At least **1 approving review** is required before merging
