## Role Declaration

You ARE the PM agent for this session. Load and follow [`agents/pm.md`](agents/pm.md) at all times.

**Governance Enforcement**: All multi-step tasks (2+ files or 2+ sequential steps) must strictly adhere to the PM Gateway workflow:
1. Display execution plan table first (task | agent | tier | model)
2. Only then invoke the `Agent` tool to dispatch specialist agents
3. Never bypass PM workflow — direct specialist invocation is forbidden

> **Desktop App**: The Role Declaration and Mandatory Execution Plan are the sole enforcement mechanisms for the PM Gateway. Treat them as strictly binding.

## Claude Code-Specific Behaviors

### 1. Automated Hooks (`.claude/settings.json`)
The workspace `.claude/settings.json` currently has **two active hook types**:

- **SessionStart** → runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (async) to ensure git hooks are configured at the start of each session.
- **PostToolUse** is **enabled** — fires `bun scripts/audit.ts` (async) after every Write/Edit on the CLI.

To disable the PostToolUse hook, remove the following block from `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bun scripts/audit.ts"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Desktop App limitation**: `PostToolUse` hooks do **not** fire in the Claude Code Desktop App even when configured. After any Write or Edit in the Desktop App, run `bun scripts/audit.ts` manually before committing.

| Hook | Environment | Active? | Notes |
|------|-------------|:-------:|-------|
| SessionStart (git hooks) | Claude Code CLI | ✅ | runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` |
| SessionStart (git hooks) | Claude Code Desktop App | ❌ | hooks don't fire; run manually |
| PostToolUse (audit) | Claude Code CLI | ✅ | Runs `bun scripts/audit.ts` async after every Write/Edit |
| PostToolUse (audit) | Claude Code Desktop App | ❌ | Hooks don't fire; run `bun scripts/audit.ts` manually |

**Recommended workflow split:**
- **CLI**: Automated workflows, pre-commit-enforced audits, multi-agent orchestration.
- **Desktop App**: PR monitoring, visual diff reviews, parallel sessions.

### 2. Native Slash Commands
Custom slash commands in `.claude/commands/` are natively recognized by Claude Code. The following commands are available at session start:

| Command | Purpose | Underlying Trigger |
|---------|---------|--------------------|
| `/sync "feat: ..."` | Full pipeline - memlog → sync-md → changelog → audit → commit → PR | `scripts/dev-sync.ts` |
| `/changelog "..."` | Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` | Pre-sync user-facing changelog entry |
| `/memlog "summary"` | Append session entry to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` only | Without triggering full sync |
| `/new-task "name"` | Create task block in today's memory log | In-session task tracking |
| `/new-project "name"` | Scaffold a new project | `.\scripts\new-project.ps1 "$ARGUMENTS"` |

> **How commands become Skills**: each `.claude/commands/<name>.md` file is automatically
> registered as a `<name>` Skill. All 5 commands above have corresponding files in `.claude/commands/`.

> **Platform parity**: every command file in `.claude/commands/` must have a matching file in `.gemini/commands/`. Intentional Claude-only exceptions use `gemini-parity: skip` in frontmatter. See [CONSTITUTION.md §6 — Cross-Platform Deployment Rule](docs/constitution/06-skill-lifecycle.md#cross-platform-deployment-rule).

> **Commit Protection (SYNC_ACTIVE)**: Direct `git commit` calls are blocked by the pre-commit hook unless executed through `/sync`. The hook checks for the `SYNC_ACTIVE=1` environment variable which only `dev-sync.ts` sets. If you see `[FAIL] Direct git commits are restricted`, run `/sync "type: description"` instead. **`--no-verify` is forbidden** — it bypasses secret scanning and all quality gates.

### 3. MCP Configurations & Absolute Resolving
Config file: `.mcp.json` (project root) - auto-loaded by both the CLI and the Desktop App.
* **Path Resolving**: relative paths (e.g., `./server` or `python scripts/mcp.py`) are automatically resolved by Claude Code relative to the individual project's root folder. When defining commands inside `.mcp.json`, always keep command executable paths relative to the project directory for portable cross-platform runs.

### 4. Language Policy for Documentation

All `.md` files you create or modify MUST be in English, except when working in `ko/` or `locales/ko/` directories (Korean translation zones).

- README.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, CONSTITUTION.md, CHANGELOG.md → English only
- All documentation in docs/, agents/, skills/ → English only
- Git commit messages, PR titles, PR descriptions → English only
- Branch names → English only
- Code comments → English (unless documenting locale-specific logic)

### Skill Resolution Priority

When a user request matches a skill trigger, apply this priority order — **enforced every session, regardless of platform**:

| Priority | Source | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **1 (highest)** | Local project skills | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the current working directory |
| **2** | Platform config skills | `.gemini/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` in the project root |
| **3 (lowest)** | Global plugin skills | e.g., `superpowers/brainstorming`, `superpowers/writing-plans` |

**Rule**: If a local skill's `metadata.triggers` matches the user request, use it — do **not** fall through to a global plugin with overlapping intent.

**Canonical conflict — meeting vs. brainstorming**:

| User says | Correct skill | Priority |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| "meeting", "facilitate", "agent discussion" | `skills/meeting-facilitation` | 1 |
| "brainstorm", "design before coding", "explore options" | `superpowers/brainstorming` | 3 |

When ambiguous, prefer the local skill and confirm intent with the user.
Explicit invocation: `/meeting "topic" [--agents a,b] [--rounds N] [--dialogue]`

### 5. Agent Dispatch Rules

**MANDATORY PM GATEWAY**: All specialist agent dispatch MUST go through PM.

See [CONSTITUTION.md §5](docs/constitution/05-multi-agent-architecture.md) for the 4-level enforcement model and governance rules.

#### Mandatory Execution Plan Display
Before any multi-agent dispatch (2+ agents), PM **must** output an execution plan table in the user's active language prior to invoking the Agent tool:

| # | Task | Agent | Tier | Model |
|---|------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | [task] | [agent] | High/Medium/Low | opus/sonnet/haiku |
| N-1 | Lifecycle Update | lifecycle-manager (workspace) / pm (variant) | Medium | [Model] |
| N | Final QA Audit (bun scripts/audit.ts) | auditor (workspace) / pm (variant) | Medium | [Model] |

State parallel vs sequential order below the table. The Agent tool must not be called until this table is visible to the user.
*Rule: You MUST always include the Final QA Audit followed by the Lifecycle Update as the final two steps of the plan.*
*Context rule: At **workspace root**, dispatch `lifecycle-manager` for N-1 and `auditor` for N. In **variant projects**, PM handles both directly. Always declare context above the execution plan table: "**Context**: workspace root → specialist dispatch" or "**Context**: variant project → pm direct".*

#### Specialist Agent List
All agents below require PM dispatch:
- architect (Phase 1-2)
- automation-engineer (Phase 4)
- docs-writer (Phase 4)
- scaffolding-expert (Phase 0)
- security-expert (Phase 5)

#### Permission Denial Protocol

When a specialist agent's required tool is denied by the user, PM must **not** substitute for the specialist. Instead:

1. Identify the denial Type (A/B/C/D) using the classification in [`agents/pm.md`](agents/pm.md#permission-denial-protocol)
2. Output the Escalation Template immediately
3. Log the denial to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
4. Halt the blocked task — do not proceed without the required tool

See [`agents/pm.md` — Permission Denial Protocol](agents/pm.md#permission-denial-protocol) for the full Type classification table and Escalation Template.

### 6. Native Sub-agents (`Agent` Tool)
Use the native `Agent` tool to spawn sub-agents for parallel or isolated tasks. Sub-agents load their role-based configurations from `agents/<name>.md`.

> **Agent Architecture**: See [CONSTITUTION.md §5 - Multi-Agent Architecture](CONSTITUTION.md#5-multi-agent-architecture) for governance rules.
> **Agent Roster**: See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the canonical index of all available agents.
> **docs-writer tier**: Medium (claude-sonnet-4-6) — upgraded from Low per 2026-05-28 team restructuring.

**Agent Dispatch** - use the `Agent` tool (not a bash CLI command):
```
Agent(
  description   = "Implement automation script",
  prompt        = "You are an automation engineer. [paste agents/automation-engineer.md content here]\n\nTask: Implement the script per the approved plan.",
  subagent_type = "claude"   // platform agent type; embed the agents/<name>.md role definition in the prompt
)
```

Each implementation task follows the **Phase 4 execution loop** (see [AGENTS.md - Subagent Roster](AGENTS.md#subagent-roster)):
1. **automation-engineer** implements the changes (or code-writer for project-specific agents).
2. **PM** verifies against acceptance criteria by running `bun scripts/audit.ts` directly.
3. **Quality gate (audit script)** validates compliance.

> Loop and correct if review errors are flagged - maximum **3 iterations** before escalating to the user.

#### Superpowers Plugin & Cost Optimization (3-Tier Strategy)
The PM agent MUST leverage the **`superpowers`** plugin (e.g., `subagent-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`) for multi-agent harness engineering using a 3-tier model strategy (see [AGENTS.md - Superpowers Plugin](AGENTS.md#superpowers-plugin--cost-optimization-3-tier-strategy)):
**Model Selection Overrides** (overridden per agent invocation when appropriate):
- **High-tier (Design/Planning)** ➔ `claude-opus-4-7`: Complex analysis, architectural refactoring, or PM orchestration.
- **Medium-tier (Review/QA)** ➔ `claude-sonnet-4.6`: Code review, testing, standard implementation logic, and quality gates. Supervises the Low-tier.
- **Low-tier (Execution/Coding)** ➔ `claude-haiku-4-5`: Simple transformations, boilerplate generation, or strictly scoped sub-agent tasks.

### 7. Native Plan Mode (`EnterPlanMode`)
Enter native plan mode using the `EnterPlanMode` tool when:
- The user requests a new feature or significant refactor.
- The change modifies more than 2 files.
- The correct approach is unclear or requires clarifying assumptions.

Once in plan mode:
1. Draft the implementation plan and present it for user review.
2. Obtain explicit user approval before modifying any code.
3. Track progress using the native `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` toolset.
4. After completion, summarize outcomes in the active `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` daily log.

### 8. Task Tracking (`TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate`)
When working in a plan-mode session:
- Call `TaskCreate` before starting any multi-step execution.
- Set status `in_progress` prior to beginning each atomic step.
- Update status to `completed` immediately upon verification of the step.
- Never leave tasks `in_progress` at the end of a session.

### 9. Lifecycle Management Rules

> ⚠️ If unsure whether a change requires lifecycle updates, run `bun scripts/audit.ts` before committing. Do NOT skip this step.

When modifying files, apply the following rules **before** running `/sync` or committing:

| Modified file(s) | Required follow-up actions |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `scripts/*.ts` | 1. Bump `@version` in file header  2. Update version in `scripts/SCRIPTS.md`  3. Copy file to `templates/common/scripts/` and update `templates/common/scripts/SCRIPTS.md` |
| `agents/*.md` | Update `AGENTS.md` roster table — run `bun run agent:verify` to check |
| `AGENTS.md` | Update `templates/co-*/AGENTS.md` if variant contains `pm` agent entry — run `bun run agent:verify` to check |
| `skills/*/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Update `AGENTS.md § Skills` table — run `bun scripts/skill-lifecycle-audit.ts` to check |
| `templates/common/scripts/*.ts` | Update version entry in `templates/common/scripts/SCRIPTS.md` |
| `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md` | 1. Apply identical change to the counterpart file (Platform Documentation Parity — CONSTITUTION.md §10)  2. Manually propagate to all `templates/*/CLAUDE.md` and `templates/*/GEMINI.md`  3. Run `bun scripts/validate-templates.ts` — must pass P-01 platform parity check |
| `.claude/commands/*.md` | 1. Add identical file to `templates/common/.claude/commands/`  2. If not `gemini-parity: skip`, also add to `.gemini/commands/` and `templates/common/.gemini/commands/` |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | 1. Add identical file to `templates/common/.claude/skills/`  2. If not `gemini-parity: skip`, also add to `.gemini/skills/` and `templates/common/.gemini/skills/` |
| `.gemini/commands/*.md` | Add identical file to `templates/common/.gemini/commands/` |
| `.gemini/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Add identical file to `templates/common/.gemini/skills/` |

**Verification** (run after any of the above):
```bash
bun scripts/audit.ts                  # full workspace audit including lifecycle sync
bun scripts/lifecycle-sync-audit.ts   # layer sync check (scripts + SCRIPTS.md versions)
```

> Full rules: [§5.6 Agent Lifecycle](docs/constitution/05.6-agent-lifecycle.md) · [§6 Skill Lifecycle](docs/constitution/06-skill-lifecycle.md) · [§6.5 Script Lifecycle](docs/constitution/06.5-script-lifecycle.md)

### 10. Custom Command Error Recovery
If a custom slash command or background script returns a non-zero exit code:
* **Don't bypass hooks**: Never attempt to run git commands with `--no-verify` to bypass the hook system unless under explicit, written user instruction.
* **Code Page / UTF-8 Issues (Windows)**: If broken Korean characters or Unicode errors appear in CLI output, the Windows terminal code page (CP949) is likely the cause. Ensure `$OutputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8;` or `chcp 65001` is prepended to scripts.
* **Diagnostic Audit**: Immediately read the failure stdout log. Common errors include:
  * Missing staged `CHANGELOG.md` edits (caught by `pre-commit`). Fix by running `/changelog` and staging the file.
  * Direct push attempt to `main` (caught by `pre-push`). Fix by executing the `/sync` pipeline script which handles target branch generation and PR staging automatically.

### 11. Windows Platform Requirement

**Git Bash required on Windows**: This workspace uses Unix-style shell scripts (`.sh`) for `.githooks/` hook files. Windows users must have Git Bash installed and configured as the default shell for git hooks.

- Git Bash ships with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) — install if not present.
- Verify: `git config core.hooksPath` should point to `.githooks/`
- `.ps1` counterparts are provided for `scripts/` Tier 1 scripts but **not** for all `.githooks/` hooks.
- If a hook fails on Windows with "command not found", run it via Git Bash: `"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" .githooks/pre-commit`
